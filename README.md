Telco Customer Churn Analysis
Project Description
This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of customer churn within a telecommunications company. The primary goal was to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a customer dataset to identify and understand the key drivers of churn. By examining customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and payment methods, the analysis aimed to pinpoint at-risk segments and provide actionable insights to enhance customer retention strategies.

Technologies Used
Python: The foundational programming language for all data processing and analysis tasks.

Pandas: Leveraged for efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation, including handling missing values and data type conversions.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Utilized for creating professional and informative data visualizations. These libraries were instrumental in generating plots that effectively communicated complex relationships between variables and churn, such as churn rates by contract type, tenure, and payment method.

Key Outcomes & Insights
The analysis successfully uncovered several critical insights into customer churn, which are essential for strategic decision-making:

Contract and Tenure Impact: Customers with month-to-month contracts were found to be significantly more likely to churn. In contrast, those with long-term contracts demonstrated a higher degree of loyalty. Furthermore, the risk of churn is highest during a customerâ€™s first 10 months of service.

Service and Payment Methods: The analysis revealed a disproportionately high churn rate among customers using fiber optic internet service and those who make payments via electronic checks. These findings suggest potential service quality issues or a need for a more robust and secure payment system.

Financial and Demographic Factors: A clear correlation was identified between higher monthly charges and an increased likelihood of churn. Additionally, senior citizens showed a slightly higher tendency to leave the company compared to other age groups.

The project culminated in a data-driven report and a set of visualizations that provide a clear roadmap for the company to address churn proactively. The insights serve as a strong foundation for developing targeted retention programs and improving overall customer satisfaction.
