Project Description
This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of free PC games. The main objective was to explore the dataset, understand its structure, and identify key characteristics of the games, such as genre, platform, and release trends. The analysis involved data cleaning, checking for missing values, and identifying duplicates to ensure data quality before proceeding with visualizations.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.

Pandas: A library essential for loading, manipulating, and cleaning the dataset.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries used for data visualization to create charts and graphs that represent the distribution of genres, platforms, and other key features of the free PC games dataset.

Key Outcomes & Insights
The analysis of the "Free PC Games Dataset" provided a clear understanding of its contents. The key findings from the initial data exploration and cleaning process are as follows:

Dataset Integrity: The dataset, consisting of 407 entries and 9 columns, was found to be clean. It contained no missing values and no duplicated records, which simplifies the analysis and ensures the reliability of the findings.

Structure: The dataset included columns such as id, title, description, genre, platform, publisher, developer, and release_date.

Data Cleaning: Despite some hyphens found in several string columns (title, description, url, publisher, developer, release_date), no specific data cleaning was deemed necessary as these were not considered missing values or unwanted special characters.

This initial project phase established a solid foundation for further, more in-depth data visualization and analysis to uncover trends in the free PC gaming market.
